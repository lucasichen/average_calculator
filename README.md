# average_calculator
Average calculator code by extracting data from a list of lists
# ## Requirements
# 
# The requirements of the program are given below. Please ensure that your functions have the EXACT naming as specified! Failure to do so will result in lost marks.
# 
# 1. Define a function **extractGrade**(*x*):
#   - ***x***: A *string* containing a student number and grade in the format "studentNum-Grade%"
#   - **Return**: The student's grade as a *float*.
#   
# 
# 2. Define a function **classAverage**(*final_marks*):
#   - ***final_marks***: A *list* of strings, where each string is formatted as "studentNum-Grade%".
#   - **Return**: The mean grade of the grades in *final_marks* calculated using equation (1).<br/>*(Hint: Use your **extractGrade** function and a for loop!)*
# 
# 
# 3. Define a function **classStdDev**(*final_marks*):
#   - ***final_marks***: A *list* of strings, where each string is formatted as "studentNum-Grade%".
#   - **Return**: The standard deviation of the grades in *final_marks* calculated using equation (2).
